## 🧩 Usage Examples

* To include a custom font:

  ```css
  @font-face {
    font-family: 'source-sans-pro';
    src: url('fonts/source-sans-pro-Regular.otf') format('opentype');
    font-weight: 400;
    font-style: normal;
  }
  ```

  ```css
  @font-face {
    font-family: 'spincycle-ot';
    src: url('fonts/spincycle-ot-Regular.otf') format('opentype');
    font-weight: 400;
    font-style: normal;
  }
  ```

* To create a responsive grid:

  ```css
  .grid-container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));
    gap: 1.5rem;
  }
  ```

* To overlay a semi-transparent gradient over an image:

  ```css
  header {
    background: 
      radial-gradient(circle, rgba(255,255,255,0.6), rgba(0,0,0,0.5)),
      url('../assets/backgroundHero.jpg') center/cover no-repeat;
  }
  ```

## ✅ Tips & Best Practices

* Keep styles modular: avoid one huge CSS file by grouping related rules.
* Use **CSS variables** for colors, spacing, and typography for easier theming and maintenance.
* Test your pages on multiple screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
* Keep image file sizes optimized (compressed) to improve performance.
* Use meaningful class names to keep your HTML and CSS readable.
