# css_advanced

This directory contains more advanced CSS projects, exercises, and layout designs. It builds on the basic CSS skills developed in the `css_basic` folder and delves deeper into responsive layouts, complex styling techniques, and modern CSS features.

## 🎯 What’s Inside

- **Hero / Landing sections** — examples combining images, gradients, and overlays  
- **Grid & Flexbox layouts** — multi-column designs, card layouts, feature sections  
- **Advanced styling techniques** — shadows, transitions, transforms, custom properties  
- **Media queries & responsiveness** — making layouts adapt to different screen sizes  
- **Custom font integration** — using `@font-face` with multiple font variants  

Each HTML file in this folder pairs with a CSS file demonstrating a concept or layout.

## 🚀 How to Use This Folder

1. Open any HTML file (e.g. `hero.html`, `cards.html`, etc.) in your browser to preview the layout.

2. Open the corresponding CSS file to explore how styles are organized and applied.

3. Modify, experiment, and re-style — it’s a sandbox for trying out advanced ideas.

## 💡 Key Concepts Demonstrated

- **Layering with multiple backgrounds** (images + gradients)  
- **Transparent gradients** so images show through underneath  
- **CSS Grid & Flexbox combinations**  
- **Button hover effects & box shadows**  
- **Responsive design using media queries**  
- **Use of CSS custom properties (variables)** for consistent theming

## 📝 Tips for Exploring & Extending

- Try changing gradient colors or transparency levels to see how it affects your layouts.  
- Rearrange grid layouts (change `grid-template-areas`, change number of columns).  
- Add new sections (e.g., testimonials, pricing, features) using the same CSS approaches.  
- Combine techniques — e.g. flexbox inside a grid item, overlays over images, etc.  
- Always test at multiple breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop).
